2011-09-19  Andreas Kupries  <andreask@activestate.com>

	* generic/membind.c: Reworked the 'membind' method to be have
	* doc/instance.inc: the same API as the 'cpubind' method, within
	  reason. Started on the documentation for 'membind'.

	* generic/cpubind.c: Added check excluding use of -thread together
	 with -pid for 'get' and 'last'.
	* tests/topology_cpubind.test: Added tests for the above, and
	  fixed a few typos.
	* doc/instance.inc: Near-complete documentation of cpubind.

	* generic/cpubind.c: Reworked the option processing. More general,
	  accepting any order of options, repetition, etc. And flattened,
	  with each type-flag becoming its own option.
	* generic/topology.c: Tweaks to cpubind/membind argument error
	  messages.

	* tests/topology_cpubind.test: Started on proper testsuite,
	  argument checks only for the moment.

	* tests/topology.test: Noted the subordinate files which are done.

	* generic/misc.c: Suppress some warnings.

2011-09-16  Andreas Kupries  <andreask@activestate.com>

	* doc/instance.inc: Small fixes, plus start on the cpubind
	  ensemble.

	* generic/misc.h: New files.
	* generic/misc.c: Added to configure.
	* configure.in:
	* configure: Regenerated.

	* tests/topology_cpu_node_set.test: Moved the testing of the
	* tests/topology.test: per-element node/cpuset methods here.
	
	* doc/instance.inc: Documented new per-element nodeset method,
	* generic/bitmap.h: and the changes to cpuset method: bitmap result,
	* generic/object.c: and new argument to specify which of the
	* generic/bitmap.c: different sets associated with an element to
	* generic/topology.c: return (analogous to the per-topology sets).

	* generic/topology.c: Better argument check and error for the
	  topology global 'cpuset' and 'nodeset' methods.

	* generic/cpubind.c: Re-indented.

	* tests/topology_convert.test: Added tests for the NUMA case.

	* tests/topology_cpu_node_set.test: Converted to proper testsuite.

2011-09-15  Andreas Kupries  <andreask@activestate.com>

	* doc/instance.inc: Started on the cpu binding documentation.
	* generic/cpubind.c: Reworked the cpubind implementation, using
	  the bitmap functions to simplify internals, plus extended error
	  reporting and coalescing the get/last code branches.

	* doc/concepts.inc: Replaced the short draft notes with proper
	  text. The parts of a topology are now called 'elements' instead
	  of 'object's, to avoid confusion with the topology objects

	* doc/instance.inc: Updated to use 'element' as term for the parts
	* doc/oid.inc: of a topology.
	* doc/tcl-hwloc.man:
	* generic/object.c:
	* generic/topology.c:

	* tests/topology2.xml: New file, topology of an system using a AMD
	  Phenom 6-core CPU.

	* generic/hwloc.c: Perform our own check of path viability for
	* tests/create.test: -set_fsroot. 'hwloc_topology_set_fsroot'
	  may or may not react to a bogus path.

	* generic/bitmap.c: Exported the bitmap extraction and
	* generic/bitmap.h: result functions, for general use
	* generic/topology.c: everywhere bitmaps are handled.
	* doc/instance.inc: Starting with node/cpu set 'convert'.
	* doc/tcl-hwloc.man: Extended documentation.

	* tests/topology_convert.test: Extended and more robust (Working
	  on a synthetic configuration, not whatever the testing machine
	  has). Missing: NUMA test cases.

	* tests/create.test: Fixed left behind temp directory.

	* doc/oid.inc: New file, syntax of object identifiers.
	* doc/tcl-hwloc.man: Added section about object identifiers.

	* generic/topology.c: Fixed wrong args typo.
	* doc/instance.inc: Continued extending documentation and
	* tests/create.test: testsuite coverage of topology instance
	* tests/topology.test: methods. Reworked the testsuite a bit to
	  use XML files of saved real topologies instead of embedding
	  them. See below.
	* tests/pu4.xml: New files, saved topologies.
	* tests/topology1.xml: 

	* tests/bitmap.test: Updated test 3.0.13 to handle platform
	  differences (word size).

	* tests/convert.test: Renamed/deleted. Added a 'topology_'
	* tests/cpu_node_set.test: prefix to clarify what section
	* tests/cpubind.test: of the API they belong to.
	* tests/membind.test:

	* tests/topology_convert.test: Renamed/Added. See above.
	* tests/topology_cpu_node_set.test:
	* tests/topology_cpubind.test:
	* tests/topology_membind.test:

2011-09-14  Andreas Kupries  <andreask@activestate.com>

	* doc/instance.inc: Extended documentation and testsuite, covering
	* tests/topology.test: instance methods 'type' and 'width'.

	* tests/topology.test: Started conversion to proper testsuite, and
	  expansion to all instance methods.

	* generic/bitmap.c: Fixed warning about possible uninitialized variable.
	* generic/hwloc.c: Added check to -set_synthetic processing to avoid
	* tests/create.test: hwloc assertion and abort on empty description.
	  Updated tests, and fixups too, files where needed (xml). Folded tests
	  of instance destruction into this file.
	* tests/destroy.test: Removed.

2011-09-13  Andreas Kupries  <andreask@activestate.com>

	* generic/hwloc.c: Fixed option processing of 'hwloc create',
	* tests/create.test: plus associated updates to the testsuite.

	* generic/hwloc.c: Updated name of the package init function,
	  forgotten yesterday.

	* generic/topology.c: Removed the name information from the
	* generic/topology.h: instance structure, not needed. Reworked the
	  topology creation command to (a) properly create a fully-
	  qualified name (FQN) for the instance, (b) check for collision
	  with existing commands, and (c) return the FQN of the instance
	  as the result of 'hwloc create'.

	* tests/create.test: Converted to proper testsuite (Draft).
	* tests/topology.test: New file, old create.test contents.
	* tests/version.test: Converted to proper testsuite.

	* tests/bitmap.test: Updated for the new name and version
	* tests/convert.test: of the package and shared library.
	* tests/cpu_node_set.test:
	* tests/cpubind.test:
	* tests/destroy.test:
	* tests/membind.test:

2011-09-12  Andreas Kupries  <andreask@activestate.com>

	* doc/bitmap.inc: Moved the larger sections of the mnapage into
	* doc/class.inc: separate files, included into the main docs.
	* doc/instance.inc: Reordered sections. Started documenting the
	* doc/tcl-hwloc.man: instance methods.

	* configure: Changed package name to tclhwloc, to distinguish it
	* configure.in: from the underlying hwloc library. Bumped version
	  number down to 0.1 to reflect non-release state.

	* doc/tcl-hwloc.man: Added documentation for the toplevel class API.

2011-09-07  Andreas Kupries  <andreask@activestate.com>

	* doc/tcl-hwloc.man: Completed the documentation of the bitmap
	* tests/bitmap.c: methods. Added more guards against negative
	* tests/bitmap.test: bit ids, see 'set(_range)', 'clear(_range)',
	  and 'is_set'. Factored the relevant bit of code into a helper
	  function 'get_bitnum'. Extended the testsuite to check the
	  behaviour.

	* tests/bitmap.c: Added guards against negative bit ids to
	* tests/bitmap.test: 'allbut' and 'only'. Extended the
	  testsuite. Added checks to 'next' enabling generation of better
	  error messages. Updated and extended the testsuite.

	* doc/tcl-hwloc.man: Continued work, starting to flesh out the
	  bitmap methods.

2011-09-06  Andreas Kupries  <andreask@activestate.com>

	* doc/tcl-hwloc.man: Started writing a doctools based
	  manpage. Currently mainly a skeleton.

	* tests/sample.test: Removed leftovers from the sample-extension.
	* tests/tclsample.test:

	* tests/convert.tests: Renamed, to activate, and converted to a
	* tests/convert.test: proper testsuite, based on tcltest.

	* tests/cpu_node_set.tests: Renamed, to activate. PPlus marker,
	* tests/cpu_node_set.test: see below

	* tests/create.test: Added marker command to highlight the test
	* tests/cpubind.test: files which are not properly using tcltest
	* tests/version.test: as their foundation, yet.
	* tests/destroy.test:
	* tests/membind.test:

	* generic/topology.c: Typo fix, whitespace fiddling, note on
	  bitmap parsing.

	* tests/bitmap.test: Second sweep over the implementation. Moved
	* tests/bitmap.c: bitmap-from-obj into separate function, and
	  simplifed the bitmap cleanup (mostly centralized to end of main
	  function, and in set_result_bitmap). Moved cleanup of temps to
	  earliest location possible, usually immediatel after the hwloc
	  function using it. Updated a few error messages for clarity, and
	  update the testsuite.

	* generic/cpubind.c: Simplified the parsing of flags.

	* tests/bitmap.test: Completed tests for all bitmap operators.

	* tests/bitmap.test: Writing the tests for 'allbut' and 'only'
	* tests/bitmap.c: I realized that these operations are
	  unary. Because their output dependes solely on the id, and not
	  on the bitmap. Fixed that bug.

2011-09-05  Andreas Kupries  <akupries@shaw.ca>

	* generic/cpubind.c: Fixed use of C99 features, replaced with C89
	* generic/hwloc.c: code. Sorted the command options. The code should
	* generic/membind.c: now build on a C89 system.
	* generic/object.c:
	* generic/topology.c:

	* generic/cpubind.c: Reformatted for style.
	* generic/hwloc.c:
	* generic/membind.c:
	* generic/object.c:
	* generic/topology.c:

	* generic/bitmap.h: Formatting for style. Plus comments
	* generic/cpubind.h: added to type definitions.
	* generic/membind.h:
	* generic/object.h:
	* generic/topology.h:

	* generic/bitmap.c: Sorted and reformatted the bitmap command
	  options and enum.
	* tests/bitmnap.test: Updated the one test affected by the
	  reordering above.

2011-09-02  Andreas Kupries  <andreask@activestate.com>

	* generic/bitmap.c: Renamed 'is_zero' method to 'is_empty' to be
	  consistent with the generator method 'empty'. Fixed bug in
	  'not', missing error message when a bad bitmap was found.

	* tests/bitmap.test: Completed the tests for the unary bitmap
	  methods.

2011-09-02  Andreas Kupries  <andreask@activestate.com>

	* tests/bitmap.test: Started conversion into a proper
	  tcltest-based testsuite. Started with standard tests checking
	  the basic argument validation of the commands (i.e. wrong#args).

	* generic/bitmap.c (parse_bitmap_args): General cleanup. (1) Moved
	  all checks regarding the number of arguments to the front of the
	  methods. Avoid stuff like allocation of resources if we do not
	  even know yet if the method was called correctly. Less memory
	  churn, and less possibility for error in (not) releasing the
	  resources. (2) Moved all variable declarations to the beginning
	  of the relevant block, improving portability. We still have C89
	  compilers around, which balk on declarations in the middle of a
	  block. That is a C99 feature. Ditto for //-style comments. (3)
	  Went to standard indentation.

	* generic/bitmap.h: Fixed typo in guard ifdef.
