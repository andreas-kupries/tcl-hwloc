dict serialization

You seem to use a single command for the whole tree, and then use indices to access levels of the tree and then objects in the level.

How about

    set clist [$id children]

The variable 'clist' now contains a list of the children of object $id, with each child represented again by a Tcl command. And further

    $child parent
    $child next
    $child previous

to get parent and immediate siblings. ... A lindex around 'children' provides the indexed access to the children of $id, i.e.

    set fifth [lindex [$id children] 5]

would be the 5'th child of $id.

One drawback of this approach: The user doesn't see the deeper levels of the topo in full, only as the segment which is the children of a particular node.

Depending on what we want to do this is something we want and an advantage of oyur API, if I read it right (i.e. retrieving all nodes at a particular level, not those with a particular parent).

... It should be possible to combine both approaches, like

    $id children $n

to get all children of $id at level $n below it.


At this point I agree with Jeff that it would be a good idea to look at bindings done for other, yet similar languages, like Perl, Python, and mine them for ideas.
